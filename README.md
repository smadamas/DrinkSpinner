# Drink Spinner

Drink Spinner is a free app for locating bars around you and selecting them randomly with help of the Google Places API
See the app on the Google Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.developerszone&hl=en&gl=US 

## Installation

Please run **mvn clean install** after pulling the project. You can host and test the project locally with Expo. Use the command **expo start --tunnel** for best results. 

## Usage

Recommended versioning: 
- Node: v14.15.1
- Expo: 4.2.1
- eas-cli: 3.7.2

I recommend using a smart phone to open the Expo hosting, which will make it easy to share your location with the app and produce accurate results.
